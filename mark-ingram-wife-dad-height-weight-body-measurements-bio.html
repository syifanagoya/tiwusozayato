Over 14 appearances in his freshman season, he scored a total of 12 rushing touchdowns, which was also a school record.</span></p><p><span>His second season (2009) with The Tides is undoubtedly his breakthrough season as he premiered several new records.&nbsp;He won the coveted Heisman Trophy in December 2009, becoming the first University of Alabama player to achieve the feat.&nbsp;As he was a few years under 20, Ingram was the youngest Heisman winner at that time as well as the third consecutive sophomore to win the award.&nbsp;He finished the season with 1,658 rushing yards and 17 touchdowns, and 334 extra yards with three touchdowns for which he was named a unanimous first-team All-American.&nbsp;In January 2010, Ingram also led the team to win the 2010 Citi BCS National Championship game in which he was named Offensive MVP.</span></p><p><span>Mark Ingram’s junior season wasn’t as spectacular with 875 rushing yards on 158 carries with 13 touchdowns and 282 yards with a touchdown.&nbsp;Forgoing his senior season, Ingram declared for the 2011 NFL Draft on January 6, 2011. He was selected in the first round by the New Orleans Saints as the 28th overall pick.</span></p><h3><strong><span>NFL Career</span></strong></h3><p><span>In his rookie season, Mark Ingram was limited to just 10 appearances for the Saints due to a toe injury.&nbsp;He ultimately finished the season with 474 rushing yards and 5 touchdowns.&nbsp;Ingram didn’t see much improvement over the next 2 seasons as he rushed for 602 yards with five rushing touchdowns in 2012 and finished with 386 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in 2013.</span></p><p><span>Mark Ingram finally overcame his first struggle in the 2014 NFL season as he finished with a career-high 1,109 yards (964 rushing yards and 145 receiving yards) from scrimmage, a performance for which he earned his first Pro-Bowl selection.&nbsp;After a not-so-impressive 2015 season, the talented player found his winning way again in 2016 by finishing with a career-high 1,043 rushing yards.&nbsp;He also had 319 receiving yards and 10 total touchdowns.</span></p><p><span>Ingram took his performance a notch higher in the 2017 season as he finished with career bests 1,124 rushing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, 58 receptions, and 416 receiving yards.&nbsp;He helped the Saints win their fourth NFC South title by also earning his 2nd Pro-Bowl selection.</span></p><p><span>Mark Ingram was handed a 4-game suspension on May 8, 2018 for violating the league’s drug policy.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height, weight and body measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>Mark Ingram is 5ft 9in (175cm) tall and maintains a bodyweight of 98kg (215lbs).&nbsp;Ingram’s size, coupled with his running style, makes him a perfect candidate in the Saints’ offensive field.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wife, father and family of Mark Ingram</span></strong></h2><p><span>Much like the NFL star himself, Mark Ingrampère was also a professional athlete in his prime.&nbsp;Before turning pro in 1987, Mark Ingram Sr. played college football as a wide receiver for Michigan State University.&nbsp;He was drafted by the New York Giants in the first round of the 1987 NFL Draft and, like his son, Ingram Sr. was the 28th overall pick.&nbsp;Thus, the Ingrams are the first father-son duo to be drafted with the same choice of their respective draft classes.</span></p><p><span>Among other highlights of his own NFL career, Mark Ingram Sr. won Super Bowl XXV (1990) with the New York Giants.&nbsp;He retired from the game in 1996.</span></p><p><span>Mark Ingram Jr. is married to fitness model Chelsea Peltin-Brown.&nbsp;She also holds a degree in broadcast journalism from California State University, Northridge.</span></p><p><span>After dating for several years, Mark Ingram and Chelsea Peltin-Brown announced their engagement in July 2016. The couple tied the knot on April 3, 2017, after which they took off for the small tropical island of the Maldives for their honeymoon.&nbsp;They have 3 children together;&nbsp;daughters Mila and Myla and a son named Mark Valentino Ingram III.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGilkae4brXNoKmapV2stqexjJ2YnWWYmraotNNmrp6hl53Bbq7OnbBmpZWWwLa%2BxKacp6yjYq%2Bqu44%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmark-ingram-wife-dad-height-weight-body-measurements-bio.html&text=Mark%20Ingram%20Wife%2c%20Dad%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Bio&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmark-ingram-wife-dad-height-weight-body-measurements-bio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmark-ingram-wife-dad-height-weight-body-measurements-bio.html&title=Mark%20Ingram%20Wife%2c%20Dad%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmark-ingram-wife-dad-height-weight-body-measurements-bio.html&title=Mark%20Ingram%20Wife%2c%20Dad%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmark-ingram-wife-dad-height-weight-body-measurements-bio.html&title=Mark%20Ingram%20Wife%2c%20Dad%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmark-ingram-wife-dad-height-weight-body-measurements-bio.html&description=Mark%20Ingram%20Wife%2c%20Dad%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./news-which-pirates-players-recorded-100-rbi-season-mlb-immaculate-grid-answers-august-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Which Pirates players have recorded 100+ RBI in a season?
