Cher is widely regarded as a cultural icon, with a career spanning multiple decades. To date she has sold over 100 million records, making her one of the world's best-selling musical artists. Her notable achievements include winning a Grammy Award, an Emmy Award, an Academy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and a Cannes Film Festival award. Her name is on the Hollywood Walk of Fame as part of the Sonny & Cher duo.</p><p>After establishing herself as one half of the groovy, drug-free music duo known as Sonny and Cher in the mid-60s, she went on to become a sensation on television as well, co-starring on the popular "Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour" and then her own show, "Cher", into the 70s.&nbsp; She then found fame appearing in her own shows in Las Vegas, before opportunities on the big screen lured her back to Hollywood.&nbsp; Her return proved quite successful, and she went on to appear in a number of high-profile films throughout the 80s, including "Silkwood", "Mask", "The Witches of Eastwick", and "Moonstruck".&nbsp; She won the Oscar for Best Actress for her work in "Moonstruck", and began burning up the music charts again almost immediately, with her hit album, "Heart of Stone".&nbsp; She is the only artist to have won an Oscar, a Grammy, an Emmy, a Golden Globe (she's won three), and a Best Actress honor at Cannes, and the only music artist to have had a #1 song on the Billboard charts every decade of the last sixty years.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Cher was born Cherilyn Sarkisian in El Centro, California, on May 20, 1946. Her parents John Sarkisian and Georgia Holt (born Jackie Jean Crouch) divorced when she was ten months old. Cher moved around with her mother, living in California, New York and Texas. She dropped out of school when she was sixteen and moved to Los Angeles, where she took acting classes and danced in clubs to support herself.</p><h2 id=sonny-amp-cher><strong>Sonny & Cher</strong></h2><p>She met performer Sonny Bono in 1962, and began working as his housekeeper. He introduced her to record producer <a href=#>Phil Spector</a>, and she began to work as a backup singer. Sonny and Cher developed a close relationship as friends and eventual lovers, and began performing together. They released their first single "I Got You Babe" as the musical duo Sonny & Cher in July 1965, and it's success propelled Cher into stardom.</p><h2 id=stardom><strong>Stardom</strong></h2><p>Sonny & Cher's first studio album "Look at Us" (1965) helped them land five songs in the Billboard Top 50 at the same time, a feat that had only been accomplished by the Beatles and <a href=# title="Elvis Net Worth">Elvis</a> Presley. While enjoying success with Sonny & Cher, she also had a successful solo career. Cher had signed with Liberty Records' Imperial imprint in 1964, releasing albums "All I Really Want to Do" (1965), "The Sonny Side of Cher" (1966) and "ChÃ©r" (1966). Her single "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down" (1966) was her first solo single to sell a million copies.</p><p>As Sonny & Cher declined in popularity, Cher's solo career thrived. She recorded the album "3614 Jackson Highway" in 1969, and it was her first musical project that was made without Sonny's guidance and input. Sonny & Cher were offered their own television program, and thus began "The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour" which premiered in 1971. Following the couple's contentious divorce, which was finalized in 1975, Cher embarked on a truly solo career. She signed a $2.5 million deal with Warner Bros. Records, releasing the critically and commercially unsuccessful album "Stars" (1975), which has since become a cult classic.</p><p>Cher returned to television with her own show "Cher" in 1975, and then eventually reunited with ex-husband Sonny professionally on "The Sonny and Cher Show" (1976-1977). She continued to produce music, and has released over twenty studio albums. She had a residency in Las Vegas from 1980 to 1982 which earned her $300 thousand per week. She headlined for three years at the Colosseum at Caesars starting in 2008 and reportedly grossed $180 million from the series.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-296076 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Cher-1.jpg alt width=900 height=636 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-296076 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=acting-career><strong>Acting Career</strong></h2><p>Cher's earliest ventures into acting were "Good Times" (1967), produced together with Sonny, and the film "Chastity" (1969), which was written and directed by Sonny and funded by the couple. Both were unsuccessful. She was cast by director <a href=# title="Robert Altman Net Worth">Robert Altman</a> in the Broadway production "Come Back to the Five and Dime, <a href=# title="Jimmy Dean Net Worth">Jimmy Dean</a>" in 1976, playing the same role again in the 1982 film adaptation with the same title. Cher credits Altman and this opportunity with launching her career. She formed her own film production company Isis in 1985, and continued on to star in films such as "Mask" (1985), "The Witches of Eastwick" (1987), "Moonstruck" (1987), "Mermaids" (1990), "Tea with Mussolini" (1999) and "Burlesque" (2010). She also played Ruby Sheridan in "Mama Mia! Here We Go Again" (2018) and lent her voice to roles in "Zookeeper" (2011) and "Bobbleheads: The Movie" (2020).</p><h2 id=other-projects><strong>Other Projects</strong></h2><p>Well-known for her own personal style, Cher has also starred in many fashion campaigns, including the Dsquared2 spring/summer advertising campaign in February 2020. Additionally, she has launched two fragrances, "Cher Eau de Couture" (2019) and "Uninhibited" (1987). During a period of poor health in the early 1990s, she starred in a string of informercials because she was unable to work on other projects. Her various infomercials selling health, beauty and diet products are estimated to have earned her almost $10 million.</p><p>Cher has been very philanthropic over her career, having supported and played roles in endeavors to help children, soldiers and veterans, and the environment. She has engaged with Habitat for Humanity, and her very own The Cher Charitable Foundation supports international projects such as the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, Operation Helmet, and the Children's Craniofacial Association.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-262586 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/cher.jpg alt width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-262586 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Cher married <a href=#>Sonny Bono</a> officially in 1969, shortly after she gave birth to their child <a href=#>Chaz Bono</a> (born Chastity Bono) in March that year. Sonny filed for separation in February 1974 citing "irreconcilable differences," and Cher countered with a divorce suit claiming that he withheld money from her and deprived her of some of their shared earnings. The resulting court battle over finances and the custody of their child was finalized in June 1975.</p><p>During her divorce from Sonny, Cher dated record executive David Geffen. Four days after finalizing her divorce from Sonny, Cher married musician <a href=#>Gregg Allman</a>, filing for divorce a mere 9 days later. However, they reconciled and had a son, Elijah Blue, together in July 1976. Cher and Allman divorced in 1979. Other notable figures Cher has dated include <a href=# title="Gene Simmons Net Worth">Gene Simmons</a>, <a href=# title="Eric Stoltz Net Worth">Eric Stoltz</a>, <a href=# title="Tom Cruise Net Worth">Tom Cruise</a> and <a href=# title="Richie Sambora Net Worth">Richie Sambora</a>. Cher owns properties around the world that have an estimated value of $100 million. Her Italian villa on the coast of Malibu alone is worth $50-70 million. She is often considered a gay icon, but it is clear that her fan base stretches far beyond one specific group. Cher is a timeless celebrity, and continues to participate actively in philanthropic and entertainment work.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>Cher has owned a number of lavish and not-so-lavish homes around the world, but especially in the Los Angeles area. For example, the Beverly Hills estate she once shared we Sonny Bono was sold in September 2016 for $90 million.</p><p>In 2006 Cher paid $4.5 million for a condo in a famous LA building called Sierra Towers. She and her designer remodeled it to look like a Buddhist paradise. The condo features high-ceilings, arched entryways, Bell Jar ceiling fixtures, and a range of "Eastern" touches. The condo is two stories, and the walls were removed from the twelve room interior to create two massive open-plan floors. There is also a large outdoor terrace which provides gorgeous views of the city. Cher listed this unit for sale in February 2015, and ultimately accepted $5.25 million. Prior to Cher owning this unit it had at one point been owned by <a href=#>David Geffen</a>.</p><p>For most of the last three decades, Cher's primary's residence has been an absolutely incredible Italian Renaissance-style mansion on the cliffs of Malibu overlooking the ocean. The 1.7-acre bluff-top property has a three-story 13,000 square-foot main house, tennis court, pool and guest house. Cher bought the undeveloped plot of land for $2.95 million in 1989. It took five years to complete construction. Construction was officially over in 1999.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-339106 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cher-malibu-scaled.jpg alt width=900 height=670 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-339106 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Paul Harris/Getty Images)</p><p>Cher first listed her Malibu mansion for sale in August 2008, shortly before the real estate crisis, for $45 million. In October 2022 Cher listed the home for sale once again, <a href=#>this time for a whopping $85 million</a>. She reduced the price to $75 million in March 2023.</p><p>She previously owned a bay-front home in Key Biscayne, Florida, which sold for $8.8 million in 2006. In 2019, Cher took a slight loss on a Beverly Hills home when she sold it for $2.073 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70qKloJ2iqHyktMSrZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frichest-celebrities.html&text=Cher%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frichest-celebrities.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frichest-celebrities.html&title=Cher%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frichest-celebrities.html&title=Cher%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frichest-celebrities.html&title=Cher%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frichest-celebrities.html&description=Cher%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./shin-soo-choo-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shin-Soo Choo Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./laguna-beach-reunion-stephen-colletti-trey-phillips-dieter-schmitz-wedding-2014259.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Laguna Beach Reunion: Stephen Colletti, Trey Phillips Attend Wedding">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
