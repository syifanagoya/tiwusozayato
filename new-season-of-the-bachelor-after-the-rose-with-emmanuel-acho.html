Also, it was on March 15 that the rocky roads came to an end alongside the shady comments of the contestants and scandals.</p><p>Initially, it was contestant Rachael Kirkconnell and her husband, Bryan Abasolo, who actually suggested Acho for the host.&nbsp;</p><p>During their interview with The People, they suggested that Acho step up for the new season.&nbsp;</p><p>Altogether, Emmanuel had accepted the hosting plea on February 27, as he posted himself on the Instagram uploads. Indeed, withholding a rose in his hand, he captioned his picture,&nbsp;</p><p>“IT’S OFFICIAL: I’ve accepted the Rose and am honored to be hosting the @bachelorabc After the Final Rose this year. It’s been a pivotal season, and this episode will hopefully be one of the most storied shows in TV history. Empathy is needed, and change is coming. Share the news! I’ll see y’all then! ? ❤️.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>After two-decades-long careers, Drew Brees has stepped out of the games officially>>></strong></a></p><h2>So, what made Chris Harrison leave the show?</h2><p>Back in the mid-February show of the season, Chris Harrison made a controversial question during an interview with Rachel Kirkconnell. Apparently, his statements got the allegations of racism.</p><p>As a matter of fact, it emerged in the show when one of her’s social media posts showcased it as a scandal. Well, it was related to the pre-Civil War era and reinforced racist imagery from that time.</p><p>Regarding the images, Chris Harrison made a question which goes like this;</p><p>“Is it [not] a good look in 2018, or is it not a good look in 2021?”&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I usually get something positive mid March <a href=#>#TheBachelor</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/BXIHfF0wyM</a></p><p>— Chris Harrison (@chrisbharrison) <a href=#>February 9, 2021</a></p><p>Well, as the words were said, it later fell into the controversial abyss. Following it, Harrison made an apology later&nbsp;in an interview on “Good Morning America.”</p><p>“It was a mistake. I made a mistake. And I’m not a perfect man, I made a mistake, and I own that. I’m sorry to Rachel Lindsay and the black community.”</p><p>“I am ashamed over how uninformed I was. I was so wrong. To the Black community, to the BIPOC community: I am so sorry. My words were harmful.”</p><p>Therewith, Chris Harrison announced his leave from the show stating he will be temporarily stepping down.&nbsp;</p><h2>Now, who is Emmanuel Acho?&nbsp;</h2><p>As a matter of fact, <a href=# rel=noopener>Emmanuel Acho</a> is not someone who can be explained in a few words. Hence, here are few words for him and from him.&nbsp;</p><p>“I love being a bridge for reconciliation. Our world is disconnected & divided; my goal is to unify.”</p><p><strong>Read more about&nbsp;the NFL star and a model, <a href=# rel=noopener>Devin Goda, right here>></a></strong></p><h3>Best-selling Author&nbsp;</h3><p>Emmanuel Acho is the author of the 2020 New York Times and Amazon bestseller, “Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man.”</p><p>Apparently, his book showcases systemic racism and portrays the uncomfortable situations in the world. Additionally, it depicts the reality of white privileges and the racism surging in the community.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, he ends with an encouraging note for everyone to fight racism.&nbsp;</p><h3>NFL Player</h3><p>Emmanuel Acho is a professional former linebacker who played in the National Football League. Apparently, he commenced playing during his collegiate years and was first drafted by the Cleveland Browns.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emmanuel-Acho-is-the-man-with-versatile-talent-1024x574.jpg><p>However, Acho had a short-lived career for just around four years.</p><h3>Working in Media</h3><p>Furthermore, <a href=#>Emmanuel Acho</a> is a co-host of the Fox sports show, Speak for Yourself. Alongside it, he also hosts the weekly activist webcast&nbsp;Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man.</p><p>Altogether, Acho is a baritone and piano player and also anchors the Texas Gameday Desk on the&nbsp;Longhorn Network.</p><h3>Rachael Kirkconnell and Bryan Abasolo’s Support</h3><p>Apparently, <a href=#>Emmanuel Acho</a> stood for the couple after the scandal, and thus, they have their back.&nbsp;</p><p>Rachael Kirkconnell is the first African-American “Bachelorette.” Thus, she took his back as he took hers, stating she wanted Acho to be the finale’s host.&nbsp;</p><p>Right as he started with his hosting with The Bachelor, he put forward his intention and motive to reconcile.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more interesting is that he reconciles first before breaking the tension that arises. All in all, Acho is the one who is not afraid to speak and express the words as per the situation.</p><p>&nbsp;As per the guess, that is what makes him eligible for hosting the show, where he brings the love together.&nbsp;</p><p>As hyped as we are for the seasons, so is Acho preparing in the same level of excitement.&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>THATS A WRAP! <a href=#>@BachelorABC</a> and Bachelor Nation, thanks for having me.<br>Until next time! ❤️🌹 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/MNwwVGyjTu</a></p><p>— Emmanuel Acho (@EmmanuelAcho) <a href=#>March 16, 2021</a></p><p>Also, a day before his new start, he posted an Instagram upload with the caption,&nbsp;</p><p>“Prepare to witness conversations you’ve likely never seen on linear television.
