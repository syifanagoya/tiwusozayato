An outstanding Midwest road trip combined with the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=104 href=#>Kansas City Royals’</a> series sweep of the visiting <a class=ath_autolink data-id=100 href=#>Cleveland Guardians</a> meant the Twins entered Thursday with a magic number of one. If Cleveland and the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=102 href=#>Detroit Tigers</a> both lost Thursday, the Twins would clinch a division title during their day off.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Regardless, the Twins didn’t host a watch party or celebrate Thursday. Their manager was in the hospital with his wife and newborn twin sons while several coaches and players traveled home for a 36-hour break. If they clinched, the Twins would simply celebrate after reconvening at Target Field on Friday.</p><p>Fortunately for the team and its fans, both of the Twins’ closest competitors won Thursday, which afforded the club a chance to clinch at home for only the second time in Target Field’s 14-year history. The Twins immediately responded, rewarding an energetic crowd of 32,006 with <a href=#>an entertaining, yet trying 8-6 victory</a> Friday to earn the team its third division title in five seasons under manager Rocco Baldelli.</p><p>What followed was a raucous postgame celebration that took place both on the field and in a plastic-covered clubhouse. Though the Twins met little resistance en route to a division title, players took the time to smell the roses, smoke cigars and douse each other with beer and champagne.</p><p>With numerous rookies, players who’ve battled through injuries and other forms of adversity and members of the front office who’d never before experienced a clincher among the group, the Twins celebrated for the better part of an hour. The ringleader was starter <a class=ath_autolink data-id=UlA4Od7XQcqxdt4H href=#>Kenta Maeda</a>, a veteran of these celebratory shindigs from his <a class=ath_autolink data-id=106 href=#>Los Angeles Dodgers</a> days, who surprised many of his teammates with his endless energy and by delivering more beer showers than anyone else.</p><p>“He was getting lit,” shortstop <a class=ath_autolink data-id=JJt5LClmVDGxzNxo href=#>Carlos Correa</a> said. “I really enjoy seeing him like that. You only see him expressing a lot of emotions on the field when he strikes somebody out or gets out of a jam. But to see him in the clubhouse like that says a lot about him. It’s really cool.”</p><p>Debate all you want about what winning the 2023 American League Central title means. In all likelihood, it will wind up as the worst division by winning percentage in baseball history.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Earlier this summer, the lousy state of the division made winning the AL Central more of a punchline than anything, especially as the Twins struggled to pull away from the field. But a second-half surge allowed the Twins to separate themselves from the pack, making their eventual championship a when-not-if proposition.</p><p>Similar to any team that completes a lengthy, arduous project, the Twins celebrated appropriately.</p><p>After <a class=ath_autolink data-id=6gni6aqwiDCbUIM9 href=#>Edouard Julien</a> swooped in to field an infield chopper and threw across his body to <a class=ath_autolink data-id=37Lhi6P8B3iYy1mP href=#>Alex Kirilloff</a>, who secured the final out, the festivities began. Players poured out of the dugout and jumped up and down in concert near the mound as fireworks illuminated the sky above the scoreboard which featured the phrase: 2023 American League Central Champions.</p><p><a class=ath_autolink data-id=nWcu3OG4y3SFWsRJ href=#>Kyle Farmer</a> addressed the Target Field crowd, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=wasJTRun5QZZcbGV href=#>Christian Vázquez</a> brought out the championship flag and players posed for pictures as a team and with their families. Then some raced along the warning track to high-five overjoyed fans.</p><p>Baldelli described the scene as “exhilarating.”</p><p>“The moments on the field with all the fans are really special,” Baldelli said. “I think everyone will remember that. There was a lot of support (Friday) at the ballpark and getting to enjoy it with everyone together at the same time was fantastic.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Party has begun. <a href=#>#MNTwins</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/3OLAWOd5j6</a></p><p>— DanHayesMLB (@DanHayesMLB) <a href=#>September 23, 2023</a></p><p>The party ramped up a bit more once everybody headed inside.</p><p>Gathered in the center of a clubhouse covered in plastic and with champagne bottles popping open in quick succession, Baldelli barked a quick, impassioned speech to his team: “We followed through on what we said we were going to do. We said it. We did it. And now we really get to work. Tonight, we celebrate. So celebrate. Let’s go. Let’s do it right f—ing now. Let’s pop it.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>With that, champagne and pulsating beats from the clubhouse’s speakers filled the air.</p><p>“It’s unbelievable,” said closer <a class=ath_autolink data-id=DEwwpIWtjmLIkRyL href=#>Jhoan Duran</a>, who admitted to nerves in trying to close out the team’s first home clincher since 2010. “There was a little bit of pressure to be honest. It was my first time as a closer with a big crowd. I felt a little bit of pressure.&nbsp;… It was incredible. It’s a dream come true.”</p><p>Kirilloff probably couldn’t have dreamed of a better game for himself than what actually occurred.</p><p>Dogged by wrist injuries that resulted in season-ending surgeries in 2021 and 2022, Kirilloff capped a strong night at the plate by putting the Twins ahead for good when he yanked a solo home run to right in the sixth inning. Kirilloff also had two sacrifice flies and secured the final out.</p><p>“It’s been a battle,” Kirilloff said. “For me, it’s just sticking with the process. I’ve said this all year, I’m trying not to get too far ahead. Being in the moment, being present has always been huge for me. That was what I was trying to do. To get those kind of results, it definitely feels good.”</p><p>No stranger to adversity, rookie <a class=ath_autolink data-id=BhKIYSG6ovM5nGLh href=#>Royce Lewis</a> quickly moved around the room imploring teammates to enjoy the moment. Out for most of the past two years following season-ending surgeries to repair separate torn anterior cruciate ligaments in his right knee and currently on the injured list with a tight hamstring, Lewis made sure to take in the sights and sounds before promising to get back to work.</p><p>“We’ve been through so much adversity over the last few years,” Lewis said, “for a lot of guys, especially this year via injury, whatever it may be. Now we’re all back and going to get going. It’s time. … This means a lot, but we’re not done. I’m not done. I’m going to enjoy the next 5-10 minutes of my life with these guys and then go started on getting back healthy and worry about the postseason.”</p><p>Reaching the playoffs was hardly a certainty back in June.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The Twins weren’t hitting. The offense sputtered routinely enough for Baldelli to call multiple meetings for hitters to figure it out, including an explosive 90-minute conversation after the Twins were swept by the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=94 href=#>Atlanta Braves</a>. Then injuries began to hit a bullpen suddenly running on fumes.</p><p>But after the All-Star break, the Twins offense woke up. An energetic group of young hitters including Lewis, Kirilloff, Julien and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=LYDtlohqpS0C4joU href=#>Matt Wallner</a> helped the Twins break out of their slumber and reach the potential they discussed upon first arriving at spring training in February.</p><p>“We’ve come along way,” catcher <a class=ath_autolink data-id=4IK5FW6YUGYBFbRn href=#>Ryan Jeffers</a> said. “We knew what we had, the pieces we had. It took us about half a year to put it together. We’re playing our best ball at the right time. What it comes down to, forget the struggles you had, move forward and look towards October.”</p><p>As the week progressed and the magic number shrunk, rookie pitcher <a class=ath_autolink data-id=siyK534HDjyJe5mA href=#>Louie Varland</a> became concerned.</p><p>A native of North St. Paul, Minn., and a lifelong Twins fan, Varland desperately wanted to clinch at home in front of his friends and family. He wanted to play a night game in front a crowd he thinks lived up to the moment.</p><p>“The most ideal situation was to clinch here at Target Field,” Varland said. “I was thinking about it on the off-day, just hoping we wouldn’t clinch on the off day because it would be anti-climactic. … It was electric. That ninth inning, everybody was on their feet. You don’t see that often here, but it was awesome.”</p><p>Clinching at home meant the clubhouse was packed.</p><p>Members of the front office lined the inside of the plastic, watching as players, coaches and other staffers doused each other. Amateur scouting director Sean Johnson, senior scouting advisor Deron Johnson and pro player procurement director Brad Steil, all longtime veterans, enjoyed the festivities.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“This is my first one,” Deron Johnson said. “I was always on the road advance scouting.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"He was getting lit."</p><p>Clincher Kenta is a real thing. <a href=#>#MNTwins</a><br>Photos courtesy of <a href=#>@Twins</a> and <a href=#>@AbbsParr</a>. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/MhAzWFKye2</a></p><p>— DanHayesMLB (@DanHayesMLB) <a href=#>September 23, 2023</a></p><p>Communications and content vice president Dustin Morse poured a beer over the head of Twins president of baseball operations Derek Falvey as Twins general manager Thad Levine, wisely wearing shorts and flip flops, stood nearby and watched.</p><p>Free for a moment after a laborious season tending to injured players, head athletic trainer Nick Paparesta held a cigar in one hand and snifter of scotch in the other.</p><p>“It’s a great opportunity for us to sit back and see what we were able to accomplish, spend some time to celebrate,” Paparesta said. “And we go back at it again tomorrow. … It’s something we take to heart tonight, but we know tomorrow’s a day game.”</p><p>Outfielder <a class=ath_autolink data-id=jfbG5ipd6nEpLHfQ href=#>Jordan Luplow</a> enjoyed it as much as anyone. Designated for assignment on Monday only to sign off and briefly accept an option to Triple A and be instantly recalled after injuries to Lewis and Correa, Luplow danced and sang in the middle of a chaotic clubhouse like nobody was watching. With beats from Bad Bunny, Suave and Fisher x Aatig blaring over the sound system, Correa removed his shirt and danced with teammates while soaking up the atmosphere.</p><p>Fresh off a fourth-inning rehab outing in St. Paul, reliever <a class=ath_autolink data-id=UNlt7lx1HiFkSLRJ href=#>Brock Stewart</a> raced over to party with teammates he expects to officially rejoin soon. Relegated to participating in the 2019 celebration via FaceTime because he was out with an injury, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=iS01uW9922m9Smp4 href=#>Byron Buxton</a> partied alongside longtime teammates <a class=ath_autolink data-id=1N5Iu8LmoxwyrcTJ href=#>Max Kepler</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=uSLn2Yz7c3dvcry8 href=#>Jorge Polanco</a> as Baldelli raced around the room with adult beverages in each of his hands.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Jeffers double-fisted as well, munching on fresh slices of pie from nearby Pizza Luce.</p><p>A year earlier the Twins fell apart down the stretch, destroyed by injuries and poor play. This season they thrived when faced with adversity.</p><p>“We learned from the things that happened last year, and being able to use those this year and know the feeling we felt last year was something we didn’t want to feel again,” said shirtless pitcher <a class=ath_autolink data-id=vWN66HizxLyTGERv href=#>Sonny Gray</a>, who changed into a pair of jorts midway through the celebration.</p><p>As the party wore down, some players retreated to their families. Correa showered quickly before dancing to the pulsating music with his son. Farmer headed outside where he and his son played on the warning track with an exercise ball. Meanwhile, pitcher <a class=ath_autolink data-id=8Z9VRTeUplOp0yHt href=#>Bailey Ober</a>, his wife, their four children and his mother-in-law sat on the grass in right field.</p><p>“I’d love to do this for another month,” said reliever <a class=ath_autolink data-id=NlkBn3Hh2Zq5BlRn href=#>Caleb Thielbar</a>, who was on the verge of retirement when the Twins signed him to a minor-league deal before the 2020 season. “To be able to actually do this again, it’s crazy. This is a good team. It’s a good team.”</p><p>Any good team has a ringleader or two.</p><p>Maeda fit the bill Friday, though it surprised many.</p><p>“He was unexpectedly fun,” starting pitcher <a class=ath_autolink data-id=hmpo2d3n1HOTuL3v href=#>Pablo López</a> said.</p><p>In the middle of it all from the outset, Maeda simply outlasted everyone else. As the party started to wear down, Maeda, who estimates he’s been in as many as 10 postseason celebrations, kept going.</p><p>“He got everybody,” Farmer said. “That might have been the real Kenta and we don’t know. That might be his personality nonstop, and I’m here for it.”</p><p>Wearing a smile like the Joker across his face, Maeda upped the intensity. He poured a beer down the pants of his interpreter, Daichi Sekizaki, and repeatedly doused his massage therapist, Yuhei Matsumoto.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“This is just an absolute blast,” Maeda said.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Clincher Kenta pt II<a href=#>#MNTwins</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8cWmwlUCKE</a></p><p>— DanHayesMLB (@DanHayesMLB) <a href=#>September 23, 2023</a></p><p>Maeda celebrated like anyone who’s faced career uncertainty might. Back in April, he didn’t know if he’d get another chance. After returning from Tommy John surgery, Maeda struggled with fatigue and command issues and was placed on the IL.</p><p>Following a two-month absence, Maeda showed renewed life on the mound and energy in the clubhouse. Now, he’s in the mix for the postseason rotation or potentially a spot in the bullpen.</p><p>But before he thinks about the possibilities, Maeda enjoyed the moment, which apparently includes rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the loser agreeing to lie on the floor to be doused with beer by multiple teammates.</p><p>Though he played 5-6 times, Maeda never lost. The veteran pitcher laughed Saturday when describing how <a class=ath_autolink data-id=24zpnnD4f3lO8qAk href=#>Chris Paddack</a>, who rehabbed alongside Maeda after also undergoing Tommy John, won a round but opted to receive a beer shower anyway.</p><p>Maeda was happy to deliver. He estimates he opened as many as 50 beers Friday.</p><p>“Winning is very special, let alone clinching,” Maeda said. “The past two seasons we weren’t in that position to celebrate — which is more the reason to celebrate this year.”</p><p>As the celebration quieted down, Maeda stayed strong. He laughed and continued to pour beers on anyone who was willing as the liquid began to puddle up on the clubhouse floor. Soon, there was enough of it on the floor that staffers jumped up and down as if it were puddles of rain.</p><p>“I’m glad that the whole world is aware now (of Kenta),” Baldelli said. “Apparently, there are some things in the world that he’s into that I didn’t know about. … He was kind of the ringleader. I think I saw that written somewhere, but I think it is true. The guy knows how to have fun. I’m all for it. I’m all for it.”</p><p>(Photo of Kenta Maeda (center) celebrating the Twins’ division title: Jordan Johnson / USA Today)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k3FwbGloZnxzfJFsZmlxX2eAcMDWoqWsZZSew6q%2FyKilZqyZqbmmecKeo56aopbBqrvNaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftwins-division-title-celebration.html&text=Twins%20live%20it%20up%20after%20clinching%20AL%20Central%20title%2c%20with%20Kenta%20Maeda%20leading%20the%20way&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftwins-division-title-celebration.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftwins-division-title-celebration.html&title=Twins%20live%20it%20up%20after%20clinching%20AL%20Central%20title%2c%20with%20Kenta%20Maeda%20leading%20the%20way" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftwins-division-title-celebration.html&title=Twins%20live%20it%20up%20after%20clinching%20AL%20Central%20title%2c%20with%20Kenta%20Maeda%20leading%20the%20way" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftwins-division-title-celebration.html&title=Twins%20live%20it%20up%20after%20clinching%20AL%20Central%20title%2c%20with%20Kenta%20Maeda%20leading%20the%20way" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftwins-division-title-celebration.html&description=Twins%20live%20it%20up%20after%20clinching%20AL%20Central%20title%2c%20with%20Kenta%20Maeda%20leading%20the%20way" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-folk-music.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Folk Music?
