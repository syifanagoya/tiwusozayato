Us Weekly has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</i></p><p>Reviewed by <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dr. Diana Rangaves, PharmD</a></strong></p><p>An effective skin-care routine starts with a high-quality face wash, and many men are choosing to go for nature-powered formulas made with premium ingredients. Thankfully, plenty of companies have replaced traditional formulas with innovative cleansers infused with naturally derived ingredients. But with so many options on the market, picking the right one for your skin can be difficult. To help you find your ideal match, we’ve created the ultimate guide to the best natural face washes for men.</p><h2>How to Choose the Best Face Wash for Your Needs</h2><p>There are two key factors to consider when picking out a face wash. The first is your skin type. Some cleansers are made to be suitable for all skin types; others are targeted toward meeting the specific needs of different skin types. As you’re browsing through the different options, keep your skin type (dry, oily, combination or sensitive) in mind so you can find a product that will work best for what your skin requires.</p><p>The second factor you need to consider is whether there are any specific concerns you’re looking to target. For example, men with acne-prone skin may look for a cleanser made to unclog pores and banish blemishes. Some men also seek out formulas that can help fade the appearance of hyperpigmentation for a more even skin tone, or exfoliating cleansers that can promote a smoother complexion. Whatever your concerns, choosing a face wash specifically made for your unique needs will help you achieve your skin goals.</p><h2>The Best Natural Face Washes for Men</h2><p>Here’s our ultimate list of the best natural face washes for men. No matter your skin type, specific concerns or budgetary needs, you’ll find an option that fits perfectly in your routine.</p><h3>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blu Atlas Volcanic Ash Face Cleanser</a></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image3-1.png alt="Blu Atlas Volcanic Ash Face Cleanser" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>First up on our list is the Volcanic Ash Face Cleanser from premium men’s grooming company Blu Atlas.

The ingredients nourish the skin with vitamins and minerals to improve strength.</p><p>In addition to these potent adaptogens and supergreens, the formula is infused with shea butter and sunflower seed oil, two ingredients that work in tandem to replenish moisture levels while nourishing the skin. Glycerin further helps with moisture retention, while plant extracts add even more antioxidant power to the formula.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p>Before you add one of these face washes to your routine, let’s take a look at some of the most frequently asked face wash questions.</p><h3>How often should you use a face wash?</h3><p>You’ll want to wash your face one to two times per day, depending on your skin type and lifestyle. Those with oily or combination skin typically find that cleansing once in the morning and once at night is best to keep oil levels in check. However, those with dry or sensitive skin may find that only cleansing at night is ideal for their complexion. If you work out or otherwise break a sweat in the morning, it is best to wash your face afterward to sweep away impurities.</p><h3>Can you use an exfoliating face wash daily?</h3><p>This depends on the specific product you are using. There are formulas crafted with low concentrations of chemical exfoliants, such as salicylic, glycolic and lactic acids. These types of face washes are generally considered safe to use daily, although you’ll want to see how your skin reacts and adjust as needed.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>On the other hand, physical scrubs more aggressively exfoliate the skin. It’s generally best to only use these types of exfoliating cleansers once a week, as overuse can damage the barrier and cause irritation and dryness. Ultimately, you’ll want to look at the instructions on the product you’ve chosen, and pay attention to how your skin reacts to determine how frequently you should use it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOm5ysrF2jrrXB0ZqjZp6RmLJuw8Csn56rXaKyr3s%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-natural-face-washes-men.html&text=The%20Best%20Natural%20Face%20Washes%20for%20Men&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-natural-face-washes-men.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-natural-face-washes-men.html&title=The%20Best%20Natural%20Face%20Washes%20for%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-natural-face-washes-men.html&title=The%20Best%20Natural%20Face%20Washes%20for%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-natural-face-washes-men.html&title=The%20Best%20Natural%20Face%20Washes%20for%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-natural-face-washes-men.html&description=The%20Best%20Natural%20Face%20Washes%20for%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cara-delevingne-gray-hair.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cara Delevingne Just Debuted Gray Hair">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./allie-laforce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bio, Career, Net worth &amp;amp; Joe Smith [2023 Update]">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
