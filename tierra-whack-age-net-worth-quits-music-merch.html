One of her singles of 2017, Mumbo Jumbo, was nominated for the Best Music Video Grammy Award.</span></p><p><span>She originally performed as Dizzle Dizz as a teenager but later reverted to her birth name in 2017. But now, it seems she will also revert from her professional music career.</span></p><p><span>Know more about her below!</span></p><h2><span><strong>Tierra Whack Is Quitting Music</strong></span></h2><p><span>The singer Tierra Whack seemingly has decided to quit her career in music with short notice via Instagram.</span></p><p><span>On June 30, 2021, Whack penned in an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram Story,</a><strong> “I quit. I’m done making music.”</strong> While the reason she wanted to quit music is unclear, it’s safe to say her fans are not supportive of her decision to walk away from music. <strong>“This would suck alot if true,”</strong> one fan wrote.</span></p><p><span><strong>“I really hope this is cap. I just started getting into Whack World,”</strong> another fan commented.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/uploads/tierra-whack-quits-music.jpg alt="tierra whack quits music" width=650 height=812 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Tierra Whack quits music (©:Twitter/ Rap Alert)</strong></span></p><p><span>She also <a href=# rel=noopener>posted on Twitter</a>, writing:<strong> “I ain’t finna ruin nobody else day just cause I’m having a bad one!”</strong></span></p><p><span>The news comes just weeks after she released 76, celebrating the Philadelphia 76ers NBA success, with the team making it to the playoffs.</span></p><p><span>In February 2020, Tierra revealed she was in the process of recording the follow-up to her 2018 debut album, Whack World, as she talked with <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a>. But as it is now, we will have to wait and see if that album will ever see the light of day.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth Of Tierra Whack</strong></span></h2><p><span>Tierra Whack has had a rolling career with her successful album releases and her singles receiving critical acclaim and cash. According to several sources, she has an estimated net worth of $400 thousand made through her professional career and other businesses.</span></p><p><span>Whack is a talented artist who can rap in multiple styles and cadences. As reported by mtv.com, she has been heard by the world of her rapping, singing, chanting, and hissing on her album, Whack World. And in her 2019 single, Clones, the world was exposed to another one of her rapping skills, referred to as the mumble rap.</span></p><p><span>Besides, she has also contributed the soundtrack to several songs, including Moxie, P-Valley, Little, Aikuiset, Insecure, and such.</span></p><p><span>But it was by no means a short path to her now-gained fame. During her teenage days, she went by the name Dizzle Dizz and gained recognition while doing rap battles in the street of Philadelphia. However, she claimed that she became bored of it and, later, her mother elected to move them both out of Philadelphia.</span></p><p><span>Whack then arrived at Atlanta, where she graduated from school, but her creativity hit the slump. So she went on to explore her surrounding, suddenly stumbling herself to work at a Mister Car Wash. She made some cash in the span of six months working there, which she saved up for purchasing a Mac laptop and start recording her music.</span></p><p><span>And she finally recorded some music worth sharing with the world, which featured herself as the center of the crowd with critical acclaim to her music.</span></p><p><span>After releasing her debut album, Whack World, she became even more prominent in the music industry. Accordingly, she adapted to the change with a significant fashion style that represents her personality. She also put more effort into her music career with ever more exciting songs to release.</span></p><p><span>Some of her singles include Wasteland, Unemployed, Gloria, Feel Good, Dora, Clones, Child Please, and such.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, she is currently touring across the USA and has 3 upcoming concerts. Her next tour is to be held on September 18 at Music Midtown in Atlanta and on October 1 and 8 at Austin City Limits Music Festival – Weekend One 2021 in Austin. She has also performed at several concerts in the past, since 2015.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, she also has a website, tierrawhackmerch.com, where she sells her merchandise like sweatshirts and t-shirts. She promotes her merchandise through her Instagram account, which boasts over 770k followers.</span></p><h2><span><strong><span>Who Is Tierra Whack?</span></strong></span></h2><p><span>Tierra Whack was born on 11 August 1995 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, as Tierra Helena Whack. She is currently 25 years old.</span></p><p><span>Beginning to writing poetry as a child, she started rapping as a teenager. In 2011, a freestyle video produced by Philadelphia underground music collective We Run the Streets earned her an audience, and she began releasing songs online and performing around town.</span></p><p><span>She later moved to Atlanta to finish her high school education. Upon returning to her hometown in 2015, she reconnected with an acquaintance from her teenage years, engineer and producer Kenete Simms, and the two began working on music together. Tierra then seemingly made her progress in her music career, releasing several of her singles, which earned critical acclaim.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46toJ6qopZ6uLTAnKJmmZeaeq%2Bx02auqKqknXqywcitqmalpai2pHnMnqmcoA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftierra-whack-age-net-worth-quits-music-merch.html&text=Who%20Is%20%27Whack%20World%27%20Singer%20Tierra%20Whack%3f%20She%20Quits%20Music&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftierra-whack-age-net-worth-quits-music-merch.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftierra-whack-age-net-worth-quits-music-merch.html&title=Who%20Is%20%27Whack%20World%27%20Singer%20Tierra%20Whack%3f%20She%20Quits%20Music" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftierra-whack-age-net-worth-quits-music-merch.html&title=Who%20Is%20%27Whack%20World%27%20Singer%20Tierra%20Whack%3f%20She%20Quits%20Music" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftierra-whack-age-net-worth-quits-music-merch.html&title=Who%20Is%20%27Whack%20World%27%20Singer%20Tierra%20Whack%3f%20She%20Quits%20Music" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftierra-whack-age-net-worth-quits-music-merch.html&description=Who%20Is%20%27Whack%20World%27%20Singer%20Tierra%20Whack%3f%20She%20Quits%20Music" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./keith-lemon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Keith Lemon: Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./655c29ceca4741e84c8b460c-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tabla de posiciones Eliminatorias Mundial 2026: Clasificacin y resultados de la sexta fecha en Sud">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
